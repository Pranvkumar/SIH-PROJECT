# 🌊 CORSAIR Python Social Media Monitor

## Integration Complete! 🎉

Your CORSAIR system now includes an advanced Python-powered social media monitoring service for coastal hazards. The integration includes:

### ✅ What's Been Implemented

1. **Python Social Media Monitor** (`python-services/social_media_monitor.py`)
   - Real-time Twitter monitoring for coastal hazards
   - Advanced NLP with spaCy for text analysis
   - Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
   - Location extraction and geocoding
   - Firebase Firestore integration for data persistence

2. **API Integration** (`src/app/api/social-media/monitor/route.ts`)
   - Next.js API route to execute Python monitoring
   - Proper error handling and timeout management
   - JSON response parsing for frontend integration

3. **React Component** (`src/components/official-social-media-feed.tsx`)
   - Real-time data visualization dashboard
   - Sentiment analysis charts and metrics
   - Location-based threat mapping
   - Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS

4. **Setup Automation**
   - Windows batch script for easy Python environment setup
   - Comprehensive requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - Documentation for API key configuration

### 🚀 Quick Setup (Windows)

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup-python-services.bat
   ```

2. **Configure API credentials:**
   - Add your Twitter Bearer Token to `python-services\.env`:
     ```
     TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_actual_bearer_token_here
     ```
   - Place your Firebase Admin SDK key as `python-services\firebase-admin-key.json`

3. **Test the integration:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Navigate to Dashboard > Social Media Feed
   - The system will automatically monitor Twitter for coastal hazards

### 🔍 How It Works

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: The Python service continuously monitors Twitter for keywords related to coastal hazards (flooding, storm surge, hurricane, etc.)

2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Each tweet is processed through:
   - NLP analysis to extract locations and hazard types
   - Sentiment analysis to gauge urgency and public reaction
   - Geographic extraction to map threats to specific areas

3. **Data Storage**: All processed data is stored in Firebase Firestore with structured analytics

4. **Dashboard Visualization**: The React component provides real-time insights including:
   - Recent alert tweets with sentiment scores
   - Geographic distribution of threats
   - Sentiment trends over time
   - Hazard type classification

### 📊 Available Analytics

- **Sentiment Metrics**: Positive, neutral, and negative sentiment distribution
- **Geographic Insights**: Location-based threat mapping
- **Hazard Classification**: Storm surge, flooding, hurricane, coastal erosion detection
- **Temporal Trends**: Time-based analysis of coastal threats

### 🔧 Customization

The system is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new keywords in `social_media_monitor.py`
- Customize sentiment thresholds
- Modify geographic regions of interest
- Extend hazard type classification

### 🌊 Integration Status

✅ **Fully Integrated**: Python service, API routes, React components
✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all device sizes
✅ **Real-time**: Live data processing and visualization
⚙️ **Configuration Required**: API keys and Firebase setup

Your CORSAIR system now has enterprise-grade social media monitoring capabilities for coastal hazard detection and analysis! 🚀
